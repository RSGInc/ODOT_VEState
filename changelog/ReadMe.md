# VisionEval Changelog

This directory includes .md files that describe changes that are made
through pull requests and other feature updates.

Each pull request should place a unique document in this folder
describing what the pull request means to accomplish. Pull requests
will not be accepted if they do not contain a uniquely-named
descriptive document in this directory.

Things that can usefully go into such a document are descriptions of
build changes (e.g. unique build/config/VE-Components.yml or
build/config/VE-Config.yml), lists of files that are altered, and
most importantly, a description of intent (e.g. an issue to be resolved,
a contract task to be completed, etc.).

If the pull request does not supply an R script with tests for the
pull request, the pull request document here should contain a brief
description of how to test the material being submitted.
