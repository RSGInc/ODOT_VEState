# Boilerplate Folder

The `boilerplate` consists of assets that are used in the build process, but are
not part of the end-user source.  The only remaining boilerplate asset right now
is the base HTML file used to construct the visual_docs viewer (only available
on the develoepr side after building the "docs" target).
